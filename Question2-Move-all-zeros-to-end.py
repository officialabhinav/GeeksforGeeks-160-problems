# Problem Description :

# You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
# Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
# Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.


# Solution:

class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self, arr):
		j = 0
		for i in range(len(arr)):
			if arr[i] != 0:
				arr[i],arr[j] = arr[j],arr[i]
				j += 1
		return arr
